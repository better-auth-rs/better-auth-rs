## Add the Dependency

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
better-auth = "0.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Feature Flags

Enable additional functionality with feature flags:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
better-auth = { version = "0.1", features = ["axum", "sqlx-postgres"] }
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `axum` | Axum web framework integration with automatic route mounting |
| `sqlx-postgres` | PostgreSQL database support via SQLx with connection pooling |

No features are enabled by default. The core library works with the in-memory database adapter and the framework-agnostic request/response types.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Better Auth RS requires Rust 1.75 or later (for `async fn` in traits).
