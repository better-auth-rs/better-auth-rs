Better Auth RS uses a plugin system to compose authentication features. Each plugin registers routes and can hook into lifecycle events.

## Built-in Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EmailPasswordPlugin` | Email/password and username sign-up/sign-in |
| `SessionManagementPlugin` | Session querying, listing, and revocation |
| `PasswordManagementPlugin` | Password reset and change flows |
| `EmailVerificationPlugin` | Email verification via tokens |
| `AccountManagementPlugin` | List and unlink linked accounts |

## Registering Plugins

Plugins are added via the builder:

```rust
let auth = BetterAuth::new(config)
    .database(database)
    .plugin(EmailPasswordPlugin::new().enable_signup(true))
    .plugin(SessionManagementPlugin::new())
    .plugin(PasswordManagementPlugin::new())
    .build()
    .await?;
```

## The AuthPlugin Trait

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AuthPlugin: Send + Sync {
    /// Unique plugin name.
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;

    /// Routes this plugin provides.
    fn routes(&self) -> Vec<AuthRoute>;

    /// Called during build to initialize plugin state.
    async fn on_init(&self, ctx: &mut AuthContext) -> AuthResult<()>;

    /// Called on every request. Return Some(response) to short-circuit.
    async fn on_request(
        &self, req: &AuthRequest, ctx: &AuthContext
    ) -> AuthResult<Option<AuthResponse>>;

    /// Called after a user is created.
    async fn on_user_created(
        &self, user: &User, ctx: &AuthContext
    ) -> AuthResult<()>;

    /// Called after a session is created.
    async fn on_session_created(
        &self, session: &Session, ctx: &AuthContext
    ) -> AuthResult<()>;

    /// Called after a user is deleted.
    async fn on_user_deleted(
        &self, user_id: &str, ctx: &AuthContext
    ) -> AuthResult<()>;

    /// Called after a session is deleted.
    async fn on_session_deleted(
        &self, session_token: &str, ctx: &AuthContext
    ) -> AuthResult<()>;
}
```

All lifecycle methods have default no-op implementations. Override only what you need.

## AuthRoute

Routes are defined with a method, path, and handler name:

```rust
use better_auth::plugin::AuthRoute;
use better_auth::types::HttpMethod;

let routes = vec![
    AuthRoute::post("/my-endpoint", "handle_my_endpoint"),
    AuthRoute::get("/my-query", "handle_my_query"),
];
```

Paths are relative to the auth mount point (e.g., `/auth`).

## AuthContext

Plugins receive an `AuthContext` providing access to shared state:

```rust
pub struct AuthContext {
    pub config: Arc<AuthConfig>,
    pub database: Arc<dyn DatabaseAdapter>,
    pub email_provider: Option<Arc<dyn EmailProvider>>,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>,
}
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `email_provider()` | Returns the email provider or an error if none configured |
| `set_metadata(key, value)` | Store plugin-specific metadata |
| `get_metadata(key)` | Retrieve plugin-specific metadata |
